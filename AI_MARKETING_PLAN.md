## Crisis Management & Common Issues

### Low Engagement Troubleshooting

**If Views Are Low**:
1. Check posting times - adjust based on analytics
2. Strengthen hook (first 3 seconds)
3. Participate in trending sounds/challenges
4. Verify hashtag strategy (mix of sizes)
5. Ensure video quality is high (1080p minimum)

**If Watch Time Is Low**:
1. Shorten videos (aim for 15-30 seconds)
2. Improve hook - make it more compelling
3. Increase pacing - faster cuts, more dynamic
4. Add captions - keep people watching without sound
5. End with cliffhanger or strong CTA

**If Engagement Is Low**:
1. Ask questions in captions
2. Create controversial (but not offensive) content
3. Use engagement-driving CTAs ("comment your experience")
4. Respond to EVERY comment to boost algorithm
5. Share personal/vulnerable moments

### Algorithm Changes

**Stay Informed**:
- Follow platform creator channels
- Join creator communities (Reddit, Facebook groups)
- Monitor competitors' adaptation
- Test new features immediately (algorithm boost)

**Adaptation Strategy**:
- Maintain content quality as constant
- Be first to adopt new platform features
- Diversify across multiple platforms
- Build email list as algorithm insurance

### Content Fatigue

**Prevention**:
- Rotate content pillars regularly
- Take inspiration from different niches
- Refresh AI prompts monthly
- Stay connected to audience pain points
- Survey followers for content ideas

**Recovery**:
- Analyze what worked before - repeat formula
- Try completely new content angle
- Collaborate with others (even AI-generated collabs)
- Take a short break, come back with fresh perspective

---

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### AI Content Disclosure

**Best Practice**: Be transparent about AI usage where appropriate

**When to Disclose**:
- If platform requires it (emerging regulations)
- If avatar/face is AI-generated
- If making medical/safety claims

**How to Disclose**:
- Caption: "Created with AI tools" (subtle)
- Video: Small disclaimer in corner
- Bio: "AI-powered content"

**When NOT to Disclose**:
- Basic editing/enhancement
- Image/video generation used as B-roll
- Background music/effects
- Script assistance

### Content Authenticity

**Critical Rules**:
1. ✅ DO: Use AI to create relatable, authentic scenarios
2. ✅ DO: Fact-check all parenting advice with real sources
3. ✅ DO: Be transparent about being an app company
4. ❌ DON'T: Make false medical/health claims
5. ❌ DON'T: Create deceptive fake testimonials
6. ❌ DON'T: Impersonate real people without disclosure

### Copyright & Usage Rights

**AI-Generated Content**:
- ✅ Runway: You own commercial rights to outputs
- ✅ Midjourney: Commercial license (with paid plan)
- ✅ Pika: You own outputs
- ✅ ElevenLabs: Commercial license (check voice terms)

**Music**:
- ⚠️ Use licensed music only (Epidemic Sound, Soundraw)
- ⚠️ TikTok sounds: Safe on TikTok, may be flagged if repurposed
- ⚠️ Always verify commercial use rights

**Third-Party Content**:
- ❌ Don't use others' videos without permission
- ✅ Create original content inspired by trends
- ✅ Use AI to recreate concepts, not copy

### Privacy & Child Safety

**Critical**:
- ❌ NEVER use real children in AI prompts/videos without parent consent
- ✅ Use generic AI-generated family scenarios
- ✅ Avoid identifying information
- ✅ Follow COPPA guidelines
- ✅ Moderate comments for child safety
