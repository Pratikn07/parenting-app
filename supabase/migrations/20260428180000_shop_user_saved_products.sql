-- =====================================================
-- WISHLIST v1: shop_user_saved_products
-- =====================================================
--
-- Wires user-driven product saves: tap a heart on a ProductCard, the
-- product appears on the user's Saved screen until unsaved.
--
-- Schema:
--   - one row per (user_id, product_id) — UNIQUE constraint enforces this,
--     so duplicate saves from a double-tap are idempotent.
--   - saved_at DESC index supports the Saved screen's reverse-chronological
--     ordering and per-user fetches.
--   - rows are insert-once / delete-to-unsave; no UPDATE policy needed.
--
-- Click tracking taxonomy:
--   - 'saved' added to recommendation_section enum so clicks originating
--     from the Saved screen are distinct in shop_clicks for analytics.

ALTER TYPE recommendation_section ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'saved';
