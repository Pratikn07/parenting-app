MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOWS
Before writing ANY code, you MUST follow these workflows (located in `.agent/workflows/`):

1. **Database Changes?** → Read `/check_database_schema`
   - Check existing tables before creating new ones
   - Use `supabase db dump` or read schema files

2. **UI/Styling Changes?** → Read `/check_design_system`
   - Check `src/lib/constants.ts` for colors/theme
   - Look for reusable components in `components/`

3. **Creating New Files?** → Read `/check_project_structure`
   - Run `ls -F` or `tree -L 2` to understand hierarchy
   - Match existing naming conventions

4. **Installing Packages?** → Read `/check_dependencies`
   - Check `package.json` for existing libraries
   - Reuse before adding new dependencies

CRITICAL: DO NOT "vibe code" - always check what exists first!

This project uses:
- **Backend**: Supabase (migrations in `supabase/migrations`)
- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo
- **State**: Check existing services in `src/services/`
