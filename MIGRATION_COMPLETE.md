# ✅ Architecture Migration Complete

## Summary

The parenting app has been successfully restructured using the **🏗️ System Architect persona** principles. The migration from a flat file structure to a scalable, enterprise-grade architecture is now complete.

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ **Complete Restructure**
- **Old Structure**: Flat `app/` directory with mixed concerns
- **New Structure**: Clean separation with `src/frontend/`, `src/services/`, `src/shared/`

### ✅ **Files Migrated**
- `app/auth.tsx` → `src/frontend/screens/auth/AuthScreen.tsx`
- `app/launch.tsx` → `src/frontend/screens/launch/LaunchScreen.tsx`
- `app/onboarding.tsx` → `src/frontend/screens/onboarding/OnboardingScreen.tsx`

### ✅ **New Architecture Components**
- **Services Layer**: `AuthService.ts`, `AnalyticsService.ts`
- **Component Library**: `Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx`, `SocialButton.tsx`
- **Type System**: `auth.types.ts` with complete TypeScript definitions
- **Documentation**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` with complete architectural guidelines

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- Old `app/` routes still work via re-exports
- No breaking changes to existing navigation
- Smooth migration path for future development
